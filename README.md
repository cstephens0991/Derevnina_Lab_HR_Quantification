# Derevnina_Lab_HR_Quantification
Pipeline for semi-automated quantification of HR from fluorescence images

The files included in this repository can extract channel image files generated by the ImageQuant 800 biomolecular imager, cycle through these images for selection of regions to measure for fluorescence (indicative of HR symptoms), assign treatment metadata to output dataframes and generate annotated images to manually confirm the correct selection of regions in fluorescence images.

Please see "pipeline_instructions" for detailed instructions on how to use this pipeline.
